# Create Worktree from Issue

Find a GitHub issue and create a dedicated worktree + tmux window via `workmux add`.

## Workflow

### 1. Find the Issue

The user provides either an issue number or descriptive text.

**By number:**

```bash
gh issue view NUMBER --json number,title,labels,body,state
```

**By text (fuzzy search):**

```bash
gh issue list --search "USER_TEXT" --state all --json number,title,labels,state --limit 10
```

If the search returns exactly one result, proceed automatically with that issue without asking for additional confirmation.

If the search returns multiple results, present them to the user and ask which one to use.

If no results, try broadening the search or ask the user to refine their query.

### 2. Build the Branch Name

Construct a branch name in the format `TYPE/SLUG` where:

- **TYPE**: Derive from issue labels. Use `fix` for labels containing "bug" or "fix". Use `feature` for everything else (including when no labels match).
- **SLUG**: Slugify the issue title: lowercase, replace spaces and special characters with hyphens, collapse consecutive hyphens, trim leading/trailing hyphens, truncate to 50 characters at a word boundary.

Examples:

- Issue "Add dark mode support" with label "enhancement" -> `feature/add-dark-mode-support`
- Issue "Login fails with special chars" with label "bug" -> `fix/login-fails-with-special-chars`
- Issue "Update README" with no labels -> `feature/update-readme`

### 3. Create the Worktree

```bash
workmux add BRANCH_NAME --open-if-exists
```

Do not specify a `--base` branch. Let `workmux` use its default.

### 4. Report Success

After `workmux add` completes, report:

- The issue number and title
- The branch name created
- The tmux window name (to help the user switch to it)

## Error Handling

- If `gh` is not authenticated, instruct the user to run `gh auth login`
- If `workmux` is not installed, inform the user
- If the issue is closed, warn the user and ask if they want to proceed anyway
